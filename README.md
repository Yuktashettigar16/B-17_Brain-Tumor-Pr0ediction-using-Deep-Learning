## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 or above
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Yuktashettigar16/B-17_Brain-Tumor-Pr0ediction-using-Deep-Learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the pre-trained ResNet50 model:
   - Download the trained model (modelres50.h5 file) from this drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AJ97ea6BnOhPqwsaEmDNU-wVF4kYQBKQ/view?usp=sharing

5. Start the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

6. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.


### Usage

1. Upload an image of a brain tumor through the web interface.
2. The application will process the image using the trained ResNet50 model.
3. The predicted tumor type (meningioma, pituitary, no tumor, or glioma) will be displayed on the screen.
4. The uploaded image and its corresponding prediction will be stored in the database for future reference.
